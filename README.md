## ü§î What is this?

Do you

- ‚úÖ Use [`wandb`/Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) to record your machine learning trials?
- ‚úÖ Run your ML experiments on a compute node without internet access (for example, using a batch system)?

Then this package can be useful.

### What you might have been doing so far

You probably have been using `export WANDB_MODE="offline"` and then ran something like

```bash
for d in $(ls -t -d */);do cd $d; wandb sync --sync-all; cd ..; done
```

on the result directory to sync all runs from your head node (with internet access) every now and then.
However, obviously this is not very satisfying as it doesn't update live.
Sure, you could throw this in a `while True` loop, but if you have a lot of trials in your directory, this will take a while and it's just not very elegant.

### How does `wandb-osh` solve the problem?

1. You add a hook for `ray tune` or `wandb` that is called every time an epoch concludes (that is, when we want to trigger a sync).
2. You start the `wandb-osh` script in your head node with internet access. This script will now trigger `wandb sync` upon request from one of the compute nodes.

### How is this implemented?

Very simple: Every time an epoch concludes, the hook gets called and creates a file in a "communication directory" (`~/.wandb_osh_communication`) by default. `wandb-osh` scans that directory and reads synchronization instructions from such files.

## üì¶ Installation

```
pip3 install .
```

If you want to use this package with `ray`, use

```
pip3 install '.[ray]'
```

## üî• Running it!

Two steps: Set up the hook, then run the script from your head node.

### Setting up the hook

#### With ray tune

You probably already use the `wandb` callback. We simply add a second callback for `wandb-osh`:

```python
from wandb_osh.ray_hooks import TriggerWandbSyncRayHook

callbacks = [
    WandbLoggerCallback(...),  # <-- ray tune documentation tells you about this
    TriggerWandbSyncRayHook(),  # <-- New!
]

tuner = tune.Tuner(
    trainable,
    tune_config=...,
    run_config=RunConfig(
        ...,
        callbacks=callbacks,
    ),
)
```

### Running the script on the head node

After installation, you should have a `wandb-osh` script in your `$PATH`. Simply call it like this:

```
wandb-osh
```

The output will look something like this:
