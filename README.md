## ü§î Do I need this?

Do you

- ‚úÖ Use [`wandb`/Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) to record your machine learning trials?
- ‚úÖ Run your ML experiments on a compute node without internet access?

Then yes, this can be useful.
You probably have been using `export WANDB_MODE="offline"` and then ran something like

```bash
for d in $(ls -t -d */);do cd $d; wandb sync --sync-all; cd ..; done
```

to sync all runs from the head node (with internet access) after they have terminated.
However, obviously this is not very satisfying as it doesn't update live.
Sure, you could throw this in a `while True` loop, but if you have a lot of trials in your directory, this will take a while and it's just not very elegant.

### How does `wandb-osh` solve the problem?

1. You add a hook for `ray tune` or `wandb` that is called every time an epoch concludes (that is, when we want to trigger a sync).
2. You start the `wandb-osh` script in your head node with internet access. This script will now trigger `wandb sync` upon request from one of the compute nodes.

### How is this implemented?

Very simple: Every time an epoch concludes, the hook gets called and creates a file in a "communication directory" (`~/.wandb_osh_communication`) by default. `wandb-osh` scans that directory and reads synchronization instructions from such files.
